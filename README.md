# Prototipo Proyecto Enlaza

This will be the prototype or at least the initial idea of ​​how the application should be, once developed.

 In this documentation I will try to explain both the functionality of each of the windows, for this I will start by explaining the menu.

#### 1.1 MENU

The menu in this prototype is activated by clicking on the next marked area, once ejected the entire window is minimized, or at least its scale, to be able to see the menu in all its splendor, in this we can find a button that takes us home.

Among the windows that our interface is divided into, we can find the following:
* **Start Window:** In this window we can find a simple starting window of any application, when clicking on the button, you would give way to the form window.

#### 1.3 Usability


When we design multiplatform applications, the interface that we propose will be essential for the user to feel comfortable working with it. Bad design can cause customers to leave our application.

Within the context of computer applications and software development, usability is defined as the discipline that studies how to design websites and applications so that users can interact with them in the easiest, most comfortable and most intuitive way possible.

Among the elements that I have taken into account when trying to create a design as legible as possible and that does not provide any kind of difficulty or deficiency when interpreting its content, they have been:

* **Colors:** Among the colors that I have used in this design we find:
  * **#193566:** Choose to use this color as it is one that was already present on your website.
  * **#FF6E00:** This is another one that is present on your website.
  * **#FFFFFF:** This is another one that is present on your website.
  * **#E9E9E9:** White Drift.
  * **#000000:** It is the black of all life.
  * **#97A7C3:** I selected it for being a color that would be derived from # 193566 (Navy Blue).
  * **#ECF0F3:** I select it because it is a color that would be derived from # 193566 (Navy Blue).
  
* **Use of Colors:** The use that I gave to each of the colors were the following:
  * **#193566:** I have used this color mainly for the use of small details, such as some buttons, or in case you want to highlight small elements or icons.
  * **#FF6E00:** I have used it for the subject of titles, subtitles and some other elements in which I used it to create contrast. 
  * **#FFFFFF & # E9E9E9:** I use them mainly to create a gradient in the background of many of the windows of my interface or prototype.
  * **#000000:** I use it to create a little contrast between the text in that window, when the background is starring an image.
  * **#97A7C3 & # ECF0F3:** I use them for the menu background or for some details to contrast with the Navy Blue (# 193566).
  * **#ECF0F3:** I select it because it is a color that would be derived from # 193566 (Navy Blue).
  
* **Typography:** The fonts I have used are:
  * **Product Sans:** I use it for the titles of most items.
  * **Source Sans Pro:** I use it for the subtitles of most elements.
  * **Quicksand:** I use this typeface mainly for the description inside the rooms or for elements such as reviews. Also, he used different weights within it from "Light", "Regular" and "Medium".
  
  * **Interactive elements:** In the prototype you will find the buttons as interactive elements, in each of the majority of windows, in some, they will be a button to complete the room search, in others they will be arrows to move between elements of a slideshow, or in another to display the menu.

* **Data presentation:** In this case, when talking about the presentation of data, I think I should emphasize precisely the last window, which is where I specify information about the rooms, there what I do is precisely divide the content into different sections, from the location of said room, a brief description, the reviews of other users or a section to complete the download.
