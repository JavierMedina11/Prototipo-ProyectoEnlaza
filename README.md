# Prototipo Proyecto Enlaza

This will be the prototype or at least the initial idea of ​​how the application should be, once developed.

 In this documentation I will try to explain both the functionality of each of the windows, for this I will start by explaining the menu.

#### 1.1 MENÚ

The menu in this prototype is activated by clicking on the next marked area, once ejected the entire window is minimized, or at least its scale, to be able to see the menu in all its splendor, in this we can find a button that takes us home .
